    <h1>About this site </h1>
    <p> Having no layout whatsover is almost ok if all you want is one big column of content. However, if a user makes the browser window really wide, it gets kind of annoying to read: after each line your eyes have a long distance to travel right-to-left to the next line. Try resizing your browser to see what I mean!

        Before we fix this problem, let's make sure we're clear on the very important display property.</p>
    
    <button class="button" style="vertical-align:middle">
        <a href="file:///D:/Data%20Ruben/Tutorial%20Python/HTML/Tugas%201%20-%20120510200007/Halaman%202/Page%202.html"><span>next</span></a>
    </button>
